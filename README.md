Hi my name is Jack Nargi <br />
I'm in school learning computer science and plan on transferring to UVA. <br />
I know Python very well, Java decently, and a little bit of HTML, C, and JavaScript. <br />
Outside of computers and programming I like to lift weights, snowboard, and play video games. <br />
